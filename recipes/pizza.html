      Pizza is a beloved dish that originated in Italy and has become a global
      favorite. It typically consists of a round, flat base of dough topped with
      tomato sauce, cheese, and various toppings. The dough is usually made from
      flour, water, yeast, and salt, and can be hand-tossed or rolled out. The
      sauce is often made from crushed tomatoes, garlic, and herbs. Common
      toppings include pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, olives, and bell peppers.
