    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
      made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
      traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my
      mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
      I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and
      crusty garlic bread.

      Lasagna is made with layers of wide pasta sheets, hearty meat sauce, and
      creamy béchamel or ricotta cheese. The traditional meat sauce usually
      combines ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes, and Italian herbs
      like basil and oregano. Fresh mozzarella and grated parmesan cheese are
      added between the layers for richness and flavor. Some recipes also
      include spinach, mushrooms, or zucchini for extra texture and nutrients.
